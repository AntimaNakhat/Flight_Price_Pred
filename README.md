# Flight Price Prediction Web App

This is a Flask-based web application that predicts flight ticket prices based on various flight details using a pre-trained Random Forest regression model.

---

## Project Overview

The Flight Price Prediction app allows users to input flight details such as departure and arrival times, total stops, airline, source, and destination. The app then predicts the estimated flight price in Indian Rupees (â‚¹) using a machine learning model.

---

## Features

- Predict flight ticket prices using a Random Forest regression model.
- User-friendly web interface to input flight details.
- Handles categorical variables like airlines, source, and destination with one-hot encoding.
- Processes date and time fields to extract useful features like journey day/month and flight duration.
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for flexible frontend integration.
